# Atari-project
An end-to-end RL pipeline for Atari DemonAttack with PyTorch and Gym’s ALE integration.
#  Deep Reinforcement Learning on Atari: DemonAttack

This repository showcases a complete **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** pipeline for mastering the classic Atari game **DemonAttack**, built using **OpenAI Gym** and **PyTorch**.  
The project demonstrates key RL concepts such as environment interaction, reward-based learning, and policy improvement, and highlights how modern RL methods can achieve human-like gameplay in complex visual environments.

##  Project Highlights

- **Environment:** `ALE/DemonAttack-v5` (Atari Learning Environment)
- **Algorithm:** Deep Q-Learning (or similar) with Experience Replay
- **Framework:** PyTorch for neural network modeling
- **Vision Processing:** Frame preprocessing with OpenCV and NumPy
- **Key Learning Goal:** Train an agent to learn optimal actions in a dynamic, sequential environment without labeled data.

---

##  Motivation

Unlike supervised learning, **Reinforcement Learning** requires no labeled data — the agent learns by interacting with its environment and adjusting its actions based on a reward signal.  
In **DemonAttack**, this means learning when to evade, when to fire, and how to maximize survival and score. This project illustrates:
- **Temporal decision making**
- **Exploration vs. exploitation**
- **Reward maximization over time**
